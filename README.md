# lxStarter Kit

Another one starter kit for React-based applications.

Example page: [https://lexey111.github.io/lx-starter/dist](https://lexey111.github.io/lx-starter/dist). My apologies, the site isn't designed to be hosted as an GitHub page, so some bugs present.

Keypoints:

* Routing and configurable site structure
* Responsive design
* Flexible layout
* Theming

Stack of technologies:

* React
* Typescript
* MobX
* Webpack
* ESLint
* Jest
* A built-in documentation and examples

## Installation

### To Read documentation and experiments

1. Download or clone the repo.
2. `npm i` to install the dependencies.
3. Build with `npm run build` or `npm run build-dev`
4. Check the `dist` folder.

Or

3. `npm run start` to build and run devserver on `localhost:3030`

Or

2. `docker-compose up` (Docker must be installed).

### To use in your project

1. Download or clone the repo.
2. `npm i` to install the dependencies.
3. `npm run dry` to clean up all the example-related pages and code.
4. Use it.

I'd recommend to install it using the first way, then run devserver and read through the documentation and examples.
